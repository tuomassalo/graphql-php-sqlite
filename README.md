=======

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy `photos.db` to the same directory where you created the repo subdirectory. NB: You probably want to use a **copy** of `photos.db`, since the master database is usually locked in macOS.
3. Make sure you have composer installed, with e.g. `brew install composer`. Navigate to the project folder and run `composer install`
4. `docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -e LOG_STDOUT=true -e LOG_STDERR=true -e LOG_LEVEL=debug -v /Users/naapuri/dev/gallery2:/var/www/html fauria/lamp`
5. Install and open ChromeiQL extension to Chrome. Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/graphql-php-sqlite/server/api.php

Try with this query:

```
{
  photos {
    imagePath
    name
  }
}
```

Or this:

```
{
  photos(q:"foo") {
    imagePath
    name
  }
}
```
